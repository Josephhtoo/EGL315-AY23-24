The laptop is connected to the server through the network switch via LAN. It is able to send video to the server due to the softwares Christie Pandora Box and Christie Pandora Box Server Management being connected to each other. THe server then sends video signal to the audio de-embedder via HDMI, the audio de-embedder then seperates the audio and video signal in the HDMI connection and sends only video signal to the TV monitor via HDMI connection.

THe grandMA3 acts as the input and processing device to control the lights. It sends DMX signal (a type of signal that controls lights) to 2 DMX splitter, which then sends DMX signal to 4 DMX transmitter, 2 per splitter. The DMX transmitter then sends DMX signal to the DMX receiver on the hoist wirelessly, controlling the lights.
