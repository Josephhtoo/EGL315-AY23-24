## Controls Setup
The system has 3 main part: input, process, output, being laptop, server, monitor respectively.The laptop as the processor and the TV monitor as the output. The RFID reader sends input data when it detects the RfiD card, sends it to the laptop to process the data and will output the result on the TV monitor.

## Video Setup
The laptop is connected to the server through the network switch via LAN. It is able to send video to the server due to the softwares Christie Pandora Box and Christie Pandora Box Server Management being connected to each other. THe server then sends video signal to the audio de-embedder via HDMI, the audio de-embedder then seperates the audio and video signal in the HDMI connection and sends only video signal to the TV monitor via HDMI connection. 


## Lighting Setup
THe grandMA3 acts as the input and processing device to control the lights. It sends DMX signal (a type of signal that controls lights) to 2 DMX splitter, which then sends DMX signal to 4 DMX transmitter, 2 per splitter. The DMX transmitter then sends DMX signal to the DMX receiver on the hoist wirelessly, controlling the lights.

## Audio Setup
The Laptop sends video and audio signal to the audio de-embedder via HDMI connection. The audio de-embedder then extracts the audio signal and sends it to the amplifier, connected via the 3.5mm jack to terminal block. The amplifier then sends the audio signal to the 2 passive speakers, resulting in audio playing.

## Control Setup (Hardware)
<h3>Step 1: Connect the laptop to USB hub via USB type A - USB type B 3.0</h3>

This allows the laptop to connect to more devices via usb

<h3>Step 2: Connect the RFID readers to USB hub via USB type A - USB type B 2.0</h3>

This allows the laptop to receive information from the RFID readers

<h3>Step 3: Connect the phidget to USB hub via USB type A - USB mini</h3>

This allows the laptop to receive information from phidget 

## Control Setup (Software)
<h3>Step 1: Setting up Widget Designer</h3>

![Capture](Thumbnails/WD_config.jpg)<br>

<h3>Step 4: Add the required functions</h3>

![Capture](Thumbnails/Create_Func.jpg)<br>
To create functions go to scripting -> Scripts (Functions and Macros) -> New Function. Do this 4 times, then copy and paste the function codes under System codes -> Functions, each code for each function


## Video Setup (Hardware)
<h3>Step 1: Connect Laptop to Network Switch via LAN cable</h3>
Use the type-c male to LAN female adapter to connect the LAN from the laptop to Network. This allows the laptop to talk to any devices connected to the Network Switch

<h3>Step 2: Connect Nework Switch to Server via LAN cable</h3>
This allows the server to talk to any devices connected to the Network Switch

<h3>Step 3: Connect Server to audio de-embedder via HDMI cable</h3>

![Capture](Thumbnails/HDMI_IN.jpg)<br>
Connect the HDMI cable from the server to the audio de-embedder, this sends Audio and Video signal from the server to the audio de-embedder 

<h3>Step 4: Connect audio de-embedder to TV monitor via HDMI cable</h3>

![Capture](Thumbnails/HDMI_OUT.jpg)<br>
This sends video ONLY signal to the TV monitor

## Video Setup (Software)
<h3>Step 1: Setting up Christie Pandora Box</h3>

This is an outlook of our how Final Setup

![Capture](Thumbnails/Final_Product2.jpg)

We added 2 more buttons, green and yellow based from the MVP for users to hit reptitively as quickly
as they can, this is another scoring system that whoever hits the most time score more points than the other

## How to play

### Step 1: Intro Sequence
Press on the red button to start the instrctional video, which will guide you through how to play the game


### Step 2: Summoning Sequence
3 cards will be distributed to 2 players each, players will then tap 1 card of choice at the start of each round to summon their characters on the physical landscape.

### Step 3: RNG Sequence
Either player can press the red button to start the round. When the round begins , their characters will approach a each other and a random number will be rolled from the dice. 

### Step 3:
All you have to do is watch, as two dice drop and rolls. This is a scoring system whereby 
when the dice rolls with a larger number compared to the other,that player will get the higher score.

However it's does not end there as to determine the winner of that round. There will be a next phase which both players have to press the two big buttons in this case would be green and yellow for player 1 and 2 respectively. The adrenaline part of this is that whoever can press the quickest will add more points to their initial one from the dice roll. Player with the higher points at the end will win that round!
